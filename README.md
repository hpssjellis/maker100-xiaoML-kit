The old version of this course  Seeedstudio [maker100-eco](https://github.com/hpssjellis/maker100-eco)

An economical version of my successful Arduino PortentaH7 [Maker100](https://github.com/hpssjellis/maker100) Robotics, IoT and TinyML Machine Learning in-person course this time using less expensive hardware such as the [$13.99 USD Seeedstudio XiaoEsp32s3](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_esp32s3_getting_started/) for the course basics and some [EdgeImpulse.com](https://edgeimpulse.com/) cell phone assisted machine learning. 


Views better using the README.md [here](README.md)

This is not an online course, it is expected to be taught by a teacher or professor. Some students might be able to  do the course on their own, but many components of learning opportunities may be missed.

## Seeedstudio XIAO-ML Kit (Xiao-Esp32s3 with IMU and OLED module) Currciulum



For Arduino IDE install the expressiff ESP32 board. When loading that board look for the XIAO ESP32S3. 

Note: The Port is often named for the wrong ESP32 and that is OK.  


Video showing how to setup the XiaoEsp32s3. There are also lots of other instructions online to help with setup.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Assignments done in order for of our class of 2026, not the [Maker100 curriculum order](https://github.com/hpssjellis/maker100-curriculum).

# Steps:

1. look at the github code and hand write a short pseudocode explanation (New 2026 to combat going to an LLM first instead of looking at the code)
2. For many assignments first compile and upload the C++/C code (Arduino Sketch)
3. Unplug your device.
4. Then have a classmate or teacher check your hand drawn named circuit diagram before connecting any wires.
5. When Diagram OK, wire up the device and have it checked again before connecting ANY power (Battery and or USB-C power)
6. Check serial monitor if applicable
7. Make a very short video that shows, your names(s), circuit diagram, the board, serial monitor as proof of it working.

# In-Person Course overview using the XiaoEsp32s3-sense  
Students are encouraged to work ahead of the class as we don't expect to have class sets of all the sensors.  

Note: You will need a USB-C cable a computer or laptop to run the code and sometimes a micro SD card.  
Also a cell phone or webCam to video the assignment when it is finished.

In Dashboard, far right hand side remove bounding boxes and select "one label per data item". By the way you can switch back and forth so if you want to later run FOMO again you can.  |

# Appendices

## Appendix A: Teacher Extras - Why Not use the XIAO Expansion board and Round Display?

The Seeedstudio [$16.40 USD Expansion board](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO-Expansion-Board/) and [$18.00 USD Round Display](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/get_start_round_display/) are amazing inexpensive addons to the XIAO-ESP32s3-sense and are very well explained on the Getting started sites listed above.

I have both for my classrooms and may use them as the year goes on, but I have testing to do to find out if the color round display is as fast as my grayscale OLED and I do not like students using I2C and SPI connectors that come with the expansion board because the students naturally begin to feel that they can only use sensors and actuators that come with the correct connectors.

The students for their final projects stay away from new or unusual sensors/actuators because those sensors do not come with the correct connectors. A possible solution is to have the [grove-4-pin-female-jumper-wire](https://ca.robotshop.com/products/grove-4-pin-female-jumper-wire) I would prefer the male pins but it is electrically safer to have the female pins. It also does not help that so many boards use different connectors. I have lots of sensors with connectors that don't work with the grove systems. If you are just starting a course and know that you are going to stick with the [Grove sensor actuator system](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_System/) and have a few extra connectors on bare wires ordered for new devices then the expansion board might be a great way to teach.

If you choose to use the expansion board this ebook [here](https://mjrovai.github.io/XIAO_Big_Power_Small_Board-ebook/) covers working with it very well.

## Appendix B: Teacher Tips - Teaching Guidelines and Best Practices

1. Students work on term assignments in partners and make very short videos that teach what they did for each assignment. Note: Students often learn much better when working on their own. Partnered groups typically move to one person coding and the other connecting the wires and neither person learns Robotics. Just be careful that groups no this concern. Final projects are individual, except the optional thrid final.
2. I expect all students to try to improve and change each assignment. "Until you change computer code do not expect to understand it"
3. MAKE EACH STUDENT DRAW THEIR OWN CIRCUIT DIAGRAM FOR EACH ASSIGNMENT. For easy assignments I make it hard for the students to know how to connect the wires. I only give students clear diagrams for the difficult connections. Let students think. These are not fully made recipes!
4. For 2026 I will be using wokwi for diagrams. Students can look at the diagram but must still make their own drawing that they understand. (All connections labelled and perhaps include wire color)
5. I expect all students to draw circuit diagrams before connecting wires and have someone check the diagram and then to connect the wires and have someone also check before students connect power to the device.
6. I teach one assignment per class but expect several students to work ahead and solve missing parts of the process in small groups, also some students will fall behind, this allows us to have fewer sensors and actuators since the class rarely uses them at the same time. I can often get away with 4 sensors for an entire 30 person class
7. All assignments should be complete individually so that each student does the entire pipeline, students may work in partners but take turns at the computer
8. Students should wipe the code after they have made their video so that the next student needs to program it from scratch
9. This Github of very fast instructions allow more dedicated students to work ahead and helps student who missed a class or are good reminders for students who need extra time. THE VIDEOS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE AN ONLINE COURSE. THIS IS AN IN-PERSON COURSE! Educators can add important information and problem solve many issues that are very difficult to solve when at home by yourself in a fast paced changing technological landscape.
10. The faster students finish the course the more time they have for their final projects
11. To pass the course everyone must complete at least one final project using a sensor connected to an actuator of their choice
12. Students plan 2 individual main projects and possibly one group project. Each main project must include at least one sensor with one actuator
13. Many student's will only complete one main project and that is fine. "Robotics projects are very difficult to finish"
14. Many final projects will need structures built to support them. Any safe material is fine, we typically 3D print the structures although cardboard and or wood is often used
15. Final projects typically do not involve high voltage, water or drones for the obvious safety reasons.
16. I tell students that if every term assignment is complete, the individual final project is their full mark if that helps their grade
17. Teacher's may decide to make several of the advanced assignments optional or even set for bonus marks
18. Use an LLM such as: (What I do with the free versions) [Claude.io](https://claude.ai/new) for all help, [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app) for all research, [chatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) for advanced critique, [CoPilot](https://www.copilot.com/) for creative solutions to help understand what the code does or how to improve the assignment

## Appendix C: Why Maker100-xiaoML-kit?

The arduino PortentaH7 with LoRa Vision Shield is an incredible TinyML device that can do amazing things and has been a joy to teach, but I am part of an international group trying to bring tinyML to the students in developing countries called [tinyML4D](https://tinyml.seas.harvard.edu/team) and the Arduino PortentaH7 is just too expensive for student explorations. Also when you fry one of these boards it is very upsetting.

---

## Appendix D: Price Comparison - How much cheaper is the XIAOML kit version?

The [Arduino PortentaH7](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/portenta-h7) costs $113.90 USD the [LoRa Vision Shield](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-portenta-vision-shield-lora%C2%AE) Costs $69 USD


The [XiaoEsp32s3-sense](https://www.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-ESP32S3-Sense-p-5639.html) costs $13.99

The [https://www.seeedstudio.com/The-XIAOML-Kit.html](https://www.seeedstudio.com/The-XIAOML-Kit.html) is $22 USD without cables, and micro sd card

The [https://www.seeedstudio.com/The-XIAOML-Kit.html](https://www.seeedstudio.com/The-XIAOML-Kit.html) is $38.90 with everything 
(Esp32S3 Sense with camera microphone SD Card module and IMU OLED module and cables, sd Card reader and micro sd card. You can start learning immediately)




Very hard to compare the XIAO class set of 15 x $38.90 USD = $583.5 USD with a class set of PortentaH7's ($15 x $182.90) = $2743.50 USD

## Appendix F: EdgeImpulse Vision Model - Instructions and ChatGPT Prompt

**More Instructions:**

Connect your cell phone to EdgeImpulse, take 30 images of pens on various backgrounds, then take 50 images of various backgrounds, create your impulse (96 x 96), generate features, train and then switch to classification on your cell phone



****************   EdgeImpuls is made for an older board version of the Expressif Board the ESP32  ****************
****************  IF THE CODE DOES NOT WORK, REMOVE THE ESP32 BOARD THEN RE-INSTALL BOARD 2.0.17  *****************
**************** dO NOT UPDATE TO 2.0.17 IT WILL TIMEOUT, WORKS BETTER AFTER A FULL ESP32 BOARD REMOVE ************

**ChatGPT Prompt:**

Give me the steps to make a vision classification model on edgeimpulse.com with only an unknown label for the background and pens for the object. We will only be using our cell phone to collect the images, so it will need to be connected to the edgeimpulse site. The cell phone will allow the image labelling before I take the images. After the images are taken explain how to setup the impulse machine learning model.
